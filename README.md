# games

This is a collection of simple browser games. Everything here is built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## motivation

I wanted a place to experiment with game ideas and bring them to life quickly. Each game is:

- **Playable instantly** - no downloads, no waiting
- **Mobile-friendly** - works on your phone too
- **Self-contained** - each game lives in its own folder
- **Open source** - you can see how everything works

The games are mostly built by AI agents following my ideas, which is a fun way to prototype concepts fast.

## current games

- **Don't Touch the Center** - Survive the gravitational pull trying to drag you into the danger zone
- **Prime or Trap?** - Click prime numbers to score, avoid composites or you're out

## want to play

Just open `index.html` in your browser, or serve it locally however you like. Each game also works standalone if you navigate to its folder.

## notes

If you're curious about the code or want to contribute:
- Check out `/docs/` for technical guidelines  
- Each game has its own animated preview
- Everything is vanilla web tech, no dependencies
- The homepage dynamically loads games from `games.json`
