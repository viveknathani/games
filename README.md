# games

This is a collection of simple browser games. Everything here is built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## motivation

I wanted a place to experiment with game ideas and bring them to life quickly.

The games are mostly built by AI agents following my ideas, which is a fun way to prototype concepts fast.

## notes

If you're curious about the code or want to contribute:
- Check out `/docs/` for technical guidelines  
- Each game has its own animated preview
- Everything is vanilla web tech, no dependencies
- The homepage dynamically loads games from `games.json`
